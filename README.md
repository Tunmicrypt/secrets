This Project was done with the aim of understanding Authentication and Security.

various levels of security were used ranging from bcrypt and hashing to salting and finally oauth.

I enabled google authentication as well as facebook authentication for this web app.

I used MongoDB on my local server as the primary databaase for this project.
